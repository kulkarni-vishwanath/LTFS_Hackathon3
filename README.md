## Problem Description.
Loans are usually provided to Industries, Corporates and Individuals. The interest from those loans are the main source of income for the provider. A **top-up loan** is a facility of availing further funds on an existing loan. LTFS provides is interested in selling more of its Top-up loan services to its existing customers so they have decided to identify when to pitch a Top-up during the original loan tenure. If they correctly identify the most suitable time to offer a top-up, this will ultimately lead to more disbursals and can also help them beat competing offerings from other institutions.
